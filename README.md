Non-parametric Classification with Dimensionality Reduction

Description:
Design of a non-parametric classifier and compare that with a parametric classifiers. Implementation of both supervised and unsupervised dimensionality reduction approaches as preprocessing steps to classification.

Prerequisites:
Jupyter-lab
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib

Running:
Run using jupyter-lab software.
run preprocess_data.ipynb to run FLD and PCA dimensionality reduction techniques
run process_data.ipynb to analyze the reduced datasets output from preprocessing steps
